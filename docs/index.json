In fact, until I get the time to remove some warts, some would argue Forms9Patch.Clipboard isn't doing most developers any favors. That being said, here are some notes for your Android platform projects: AS OF VERSION 1.4, THE FOLLOWING IS NO LONGER NECESSARY. Because of Forms9Patch's more comprehensive Forms9Patch.Clipboard functionality, you will have to add the following code to your Android platform project's Resources/Values/string.xml file, before you can build it: <string name=\"forms9patch_copy_paste_authority\">your_Android_app_package_name_here.f9pcopypaste</string> I know - it's a pain. At some point of time, I'll have to see if I can use some of the trickery used by the Xamarin.Facebook Nuget Package to get rid of this requirement. I've made too many mistakes in building the Forms9Patch Nuget package - and Android seems to bear the brunt of those mistakes. If, after upgrading Forms9Patch, you see a bunch of errors like the following ... /Users/ben/Projects/PizzaTruck/PizzaTruck.Mobile/Droid/Renderers/BottomBarPageRenderer.cs(42,42): Error CS0012: The type 'FormsViewGroup' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'FormsViewGroup, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'. (CS0012) /Users/ben/Projects/PizzaTruck/PizzaTruck.Mobile/Droid/MainActivity.cs(33,33): Error CS0012: The type 'FormsViewGroup' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'FormsViewGroup, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'. (CS0012) ... then I'm the one you need to blame. To fix this you'll need to do the following in any Android platform projects that use Forms9Patch: Remove the Forms9Patch NuGet package Remove the Xamarin.Forms NuGet package If present, remove any SkiaSharp NuGet packages If present in the References folder, remove any references to FormsViewGroup Reinstall the Xamarin.Forms NuGet package Reinstall the Forms9Patch NuGet package If the above doesn't work, PLEASE LET ME KNOW by emailing me at: forms9patch(AT)buildcalc.com This isn't a Forms9Patch issue but just good advice: Do yourself a favor and never use any Android ARM emulators. This means you'd be better off just deleting the Android_ARM7a_Nouget (API 25) emulator that comes pre-installed with VisualStudio 2017."

    "title": "Using Forms9Patch Button Elements | Forms9Patch",
    "keywords": "Using Forms9Patch Button Elements Background I often say Forms9Patch was originally written for the purpose of having NinePatch images in Xamarin.Forms. That's not completely true. I wanted NinePatch images because I had used them in Android as the background image for device independent buttons. Quite frankly,what I really wanted was SVG backgrounds but all the pieces to do that were not available at that time. Fortunately, things have changed and now - via Forms9Patch - I have both! Another missing element for Android and Xamarin.Forms is a SegmentedControl (like iOS has). Building a SegmentedControl was a bit painful for me in Android and I dreaded what it would take in Xamarin. However, when I actually rolled up my sleeves and did it, I fell in love with what the Xamarin team had done. I was sold! Overview Forms9Patch has three button elements: Button StateButton¹ SegmentedControl All three buttons share a number of properties and behaviors for the purpose of giving you more design and functional options without more complexity. Forms9Patch.Button Forms9Patch.Button is the most basic, adding the following to what Xamarin.Forms.Button provides: Horizontal and vertical alignment of button's text Text and Background color for the selected state Outline and clip shape: Rectangle Square Circle Ellipse Obround Toggle behavior Background image Icon as an image or as HTML text Icon to text positioning: horizontal vs. vertical orientation icon before or after text spacing between icon and text Haptics (when available) Forms9Patch.StateButton Forms9Patch.StateButton further extends Forms9Patch.Button by adding the ability to toggle its properties as a function of its state. The states are: DefaultState PressingState SelectedState DisabledState DisabledAndSelectedState NOTE ¹ : As of Xamarin.Forms 3+, I recommend not using Forms9Patch.StateButton . Rather, use Forms9Patch.Button in combination with Xamarin.Forms' new Visual State Manager . Visual State Manager is a great feature and I'm looking forward to using it! Forms9Patch.SegmentedControl iOS has a segmented control that, for the life of me, I don't know why isn't standard in Android, UWP, or Xamarin.Forms. It's just too useful. That being said, if I remember correctly, even the iOS segmented control doesn't support a vertical layout (please correct me if I'm wrong). Using Forms9Patch's buttons Layout and Decoration Properties The layout and decoration properties shared by all three Forms9Patch buttons are: Outline: BorderRadius : BorderWidth : Alternatively, OutlineWidth BorderColor : Alternatively, OutlineColor HasShadow Text TextColor SelectedTextColor : the color of the button's text when selected HorizontalTextAlignment VerticalTextAlignment Background BackgroundColor BackgroundImage : A Forms9Patch.Image that will be used as the button's background. Icon: TrailingIcon : Is the icon before or after the label? Orientation : Is the icon and label arranged vertically or horizontally? TintIcon : If the icon is a raster image, should the color of the non-transparent pixels be set to TextColor ? HasTightSpacing : If false , the icon will be positioned to the outside edge of the button. If true , the icon will be positioned next to the label (separaded by Spacing ). Spacing : if TightSpacing is true, the icon will be positioned Spacing pixels away from the label Additionally, the Button and StateButton elements have these properties: Outline Shape : ElementShape.Rectangle , ElementShape.Square , ElementShape.Circle , ElementShape.Ellipse , and ElementShape.Obround . Controls the shape of both the border and the background clipping region. Text Text : plain text for the button's label HtmlText : markup text for the button's label - an alternative to Text LineBreakMode : See Xamarin.Forms.LineBreakMode AutoFit : Autofitting algorithm to be applied to button's label's text. See Label.Autofitting . Icon IconImage : A Forms9Patch.Image element to be used as the button's icon image. IconText : An alternative to IconImage , enabling the use of Unicode characters or special font characters as button icons. Just like the HtmlText property, this property will decode HTML markup, allowing you to specify colors, fonts and other attributes. Forms9Patch.Segment The Segment element is used primarily to populate the SegmentedController and secondarily, to customize individual segments beyond the default values provided by the parent SegmentedController . Properties IconImage : Forms9Patch.Image as the segment's optional image. It will be tinted either to FontColor when enabled and grey when disabled if the parent SegmentControl 's TintImage=true and the image is a PNG with transparency. IconText : alternative to the ImageSource property. Used to specify HTML formatted text for button's icon. Great when used with Google's Material Font. Text : the segment's optional text. HtmlText : text formatted via subset of HTML tags. See the Using the HtmlLabel property section below for more information. FontColor: the color of the text when enabled. Disabled segmentS use a shade of grey determined by the DarkTheme property. FontAttributes: is the text bold or italics? IsSelected: Is the segment in the selected state? Note: Segment's parent's StickyBehvior property must be Radio or MultiSelect for this to change in response to the segment being tapped. IsEnabled: Is the segment enabled? Orientation: Do you want the text and image placed image on top of text (vertical) or image to the left of text (horizontal)? Events Command: The ICommand to execute when the segment is pressed. NOTE: If the segment's parent's StickyBehvior property is set to None, then this will fire anytime the segment is tapped. Otherwise, it will fire only when the segment transitions from unselected to selected. CommandParameterThe parameter used in ICommand calls. Tapped: EventHandler be called anytime a segment is tapped. Selected: EventHandler be called when a segment transitions from unselected to selected. LongPressing: EventHandler be called when a segment is being held down long enough to be considered a long press. LongPressed: EventHandler be called when a segment's long press has ended."

    "keywords": "Forms9Patch A suite of elements built to simplify image management and text formatting for your NetStandard, PCL, and Shared Library Xamarin.Forms iOS, Android and UWP applications. Overview Xamarin Forms is great for developing cross platform applications (certainly very sane) but it is missing some important features: Patch scalable images SVG images Single point of use, cross platform, multi-screen / multi-resolution image management Simple, markup formatted text for labels and buttons Single point of use, cross platform, custom font management Segmented button control Pop-ups as a first class layout element Multi-object Clipboard and Inter-app Data Sharing Android developers can use NinePatch bitmaps, the drawable directory naming convention, Html.FromHtml, and a bunch of complex file manipulations to address the image issue. Likewise, iOS developers can use ResizeableImageWithCapInsets, the @2x, @3x, @4x file naming convention, and some 3rd party libraries for this purpose. Custom fonts are a bit more complicated and label layouts take things up another notch. Forms9Patch enhances Xamarin Forms to make multi-resolution / multi-screen image management, custom fonts, and HTML text formatting easy for NetStandard, PCL and Shared Library applications for iOS, Android and UWP. So, what exactly is Forms9Patch? Simply stated, Forms9Patch is three core elements from which five layouts, three buttons, six pop-ups are built upon. And, to make your life easier, some extensions, effects, and services are added. The three core elements are: Forms9Patch.ImageSource : a free to use derivative of Xamarin.Forms.ImageSource to support multi-device / multi-density image management from Embedded Resources. Forms9Patch.Image : an enhanced implementation of Xamarin.Forms.Image with border (outline) and shadow properties plus support of SVG vector images. Raster images (.png, .jpg, .bmp) images also have patch scaling, tiling, and tinting support. Forms9Patch.Label : an enhanced implementation of Xamarin.Forms.Label for easy access to single-point-of-use custom fonts, auto-fitting, and text formatting via markup tags. Forms9Patch's five layouts are derivatives of the five Xamarin.Forms.Layout subclasses - enhanced with the ability to use a Forms9Patch.Image as a background. Forms9Patch.Frame Forms9Patch.AbsoluteLayout Forms9Patch.Grid Forms9Patch.RelativeLayout Forms9Patch.StackLayout Forms9Patch's three button elements ( Forms9Patch.Button , Forms9Patch.StateButton , and Forms9Patch.SegmentedControl ) are all derived from Xamarin.Forms.Button and share the following enhancements: A BackgroundImage property: Use a Forms9Patch.Image as a button background. An icon: Specified either as markup text ( IconText property) or as a Forms9Patch.Image ( IconImage property). IconText makes it easy to use custom icon fonts like Material Icons . IconImage makes it easy to tint raster images or use SVG vector images. A button's icon can be before (default) or after ( TrailingIcon property true ) its text and at the edge of the button (default) or next to the button's text ( TightSpacing property true ). A button's icon or text can be arranged horizontally (default) or vertically ( Orientation property set to StackOrientation.Vertical ). A label: Specified either as plain text ( Text property) or markup text ( HtmlText property). Autofitting algorithms (see Autofitting ) LongPressing and LongPressed touch events. The three Forms9Patch button elements are: Forms9Patch.Button Forms9Patch.StateButton : a further enhanced implementation of Forms9Patch.Button that allow most enhanced properties to be configured by the button's state (Default, Pressing, Selected, Disabled, DisabledAndSelected) Forms9Patch.SegmentControl : a segmented button control that allows for border, separator, and shadow control. Note that there is currently no support for background images. Forms9Patch's pop-up elements can be thought of as Forms9Patch layout elements (outline and background image capabilities) that rendere with full page overlay backgrounds and the ability to be canceled by tapping the background. These popup elements are: Forms9Patch.ModalPopup : takes the enhancements (borders; patch-scalable, tintable, tile-able background images; shadows) from Forms9Patch.Frame and puts it into a pop-up layout. Forms9Patch.BubblePopup : goes a step further than Forms9Patch.ModalPopup by pointing to a target Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement . The pointer has PointerLength , PointerTipRadius and PointerCornerRadius properties. Forms9Patch.ActivityIndicatorPopup : a convenience element that presents a Xamarin.Forms.ActivityIndicator over a page overlay. Forms9Patch.Toast : a convenience element that presents a title, a message and an optional confirmation button. Forms9Patch.PermissionPopup : a convenience element that presents a title, a message, and an accept and a decline button. Forms9Patch.TargetedToast : similar to Forms9Patch.Toast but enhanced to point to a Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement . Then there are Forms9Patch's extensions. A few noteworthy ones are: Color Extensions: Blend two colors, change a color's opacity, convert between Xamarin.Forms.Color and string representations. WebView Extensions: Print the contents of a Xamarin.Forms.WebView (currently iOS and Android only). HtmlString Extensions: Convert HTML markup to a PNG file. And lastly is Forms9Patch's services: Keyboard Service: Want to put away the system keyboard? Want to be notified when the system keyboard appears or disappears? Keyboard Key Listener: What to know when a shortcut key is pressed? What about matching a shortcut key to a VisualElement so you only get the event when that VisualElement is in focus? Key Clicks Service: Do you want to make a system keyboard sound (and vibration, if available)? Application Info Service: Do you want to quickly know your application's Name, Bundle/Package ID, Build number and Version string? OS Info Service: What is the version of the device's operating system? Clipboard: Copy/paste text, HTML text, and multiple objects (they can be of the same or different MIME types) within your app or to other apps. Inter-app Data Sharing: Notice how some apps have a Share icon that presents a list of applications (and, on iOS services - like Print ) to share data?"

    "title": "Using Embedded Resource Custom Fonts | Forms9Patch",
    "keywords": "Using Embedded Resource Custom Fonts Forms9Patch's label and button elements have built in support for using Embedded Resource custom fonts - a much simpler approach to custom fonts. Likewise, Forms9Patch provides the Forms9Patch.EmbeddedResourceFontEffect effect to make using Embedded Resource custom fonts easier for all Xamarin.Forms elements that have the FontFamily property. Adding your custom font as an Embedded Resource Below is an example of how to use Forms9Patch's custom font management. The example uses Google's Material Design Icons font , which they have been nice enough to license under the Creative Common Attribution 4.0 International License (CC-BY 4.0) ! Follow one of the below Getting Started guides to create a .NetStandard Xamarin Forms cross-platform app with the MyDemoApp assembly namespace. Getting Started: VisualStudio 2017 for Mac Getting Started: VisualStudio 2017 for Windows Create a Resources folder in the app's shared code (.NetStandard) project: Right click on your .NetStandard project and select Add / New Folder . A New Folder folder should appear. Rename it Resources . Before After Create a Fonts folder under the Resources folder in the app's shared code (.NetStandard) project Save the MaterialIcons-Regular.ttf custom font file to the Resources/Fonts folder. I prefer to drag it from OSX Finder or Windows File Explorer into the Resources/Fonts folder in VisualStudio. Set the Build Action to EmbeddedResource for this custom font. Make note of the Resource ID of this custom font. See Embedded Resource Id Naming Convention for details. Your Embedded Resource custom font is now ready for use by Forms9Patch label and button elements and for any Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement that supports the FontFamily property. Embedded Resource custom font with Forms9Patch.Label This section assumes you've added your custom font to your Shared Code project, as described in Adding your custom font as an Embedded Resource , above. Open your shared source (.NetStandard) application source file ( MyDemoApp.cs in this example) Change the Label element to a Forms9Patch Label: Note: The XAlign and YAlign properties have long ago been deprecated by Xamarin. As such, I didn't implement them in Forms9Patch. Use HorizontalTextAlignment and VerticalTextAlignment instead. Set the FontFamily property to the font's EmbeddedResource ID If you compile and run now, you should see some very unexpected output. Why? Because the Material Icons doesn't have support for most standard characters! Because we're using Material Icons (which is great for symbols but terrible for text), we are going to need to non-latin, unicode characters to our string. With Forms9Patch, we have some options for specifying unicode characters. Here are three approaches to getting the label in this example to display the following Material-Icon characters: Copy and Paste A lot of times, you can get a Unicode character by copying it from a web page or from an application (like FontBook on OSX). Once you copy it, you can then paste it into your string in Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio. For your convenience, here [    ] (between the brackets) are the unicode characters for the Material Icons Font's sissors, airplane, and umbrella characters. When you copy them and paste into a string in VisualStudio, they will appear as shown below. If you use that string as the text for Forms9Patch.Label using the MaterialIcons-Regular.ttf font, it will render as shown, above. C# unicode escape code C# makes unicode pretty easy via escape codes ... as long as the character is 16 bit! For the Material Icons font, you can go to https://design.google.com/icons , select the charactor (icon in this case) you want. Then, at the bottom right of the page, select < > ICON FONT . There you can find the hexadecimal excape code (see \"For IE9 and below\"). For the scissors, it is &#xE14E; . For the airplane, is be &#xE195; . And for the umbrella, it is &#xEB3E; . Since each has 4 hexadecimal characters, they all are 16 bit unicode - and I get to avoid explaining how to deal with 32 bit unicode. In our example, replace \"Welcome to Xamarin Forms\" with \"\\uE14E \\uE195 \\uEB3E\" . Notice, for each escape code, that the leading &# was replaced with \\u and the trailing semicolon was dropped. HtmlText property By design, HTML does a great job with Unicode. The HtmlLabel property wouldn't be useful without that magic. For this example, remember (above) that the HTML escape codes we found on Google's Material Design Icons page were (Scissors= &#xE14E; . Airplane= &#xE195; . Umbrella= &#xEB3E; . ). Since these are HTML escape codes, we can pass them in a string to the HtmlText property. Embedded Resource custom fonts with Xamarin.Forms text elements + EmbeddedResourceFontEffect This section assumes you've added your custom font to your Shared Code project, as described in Adding your custom font as an Embedded Resource , above. Open your shared source (.NetStandard) application source file ( MyDemoApp.cs in this example) Using an existing Xamarin.Forms.Label element or create a new one. Set the FontFamily property to the font's EmbeddedResource ID. Add the EmbeddedResourceFontEffect to your Xamarin.Forms text elements. Shown above are two different approaches to this."

Initialize Forms9Patch in each of your platform projects: Android: Open MainActivity.cs in your solution's Android platform project. Between global::Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init(this, bundle); and LoadApplication(new App()); , add the Forms9Patch.Droid initialization call using the key for the LinkTest applications. The result should look like the following: global::Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init(this, bundle); Forms9Patch.Droid.Settings.Initialize(this); LoadApplication(new App()); iOS: Open AppDelegate.cs in your solution's iOS platform project. Between global::Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init(); and LoadApplication(new App()); , add the Forms9Patch.iOS initialization call using the key for the LinkTest applications. The result should look like the following: global::Xamarin.Forms.Forms.Init(); Forms9Patch.iOS.Settings.Initialize(this); LoadApplication(new App()); Update your application's MainPage content (MainPage.xaml) to use Forms9Patch elements: In Solution Explorer, in the LinkTest project, double-click MainPage.xaml to open it. Update MainPage.xaml with the following code. This code declaratively defines the user interface for the page. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> <ContentPage xmlns=\"http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms\" xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml\" xmlns:Forms9Patch=\"clr-namespace:Forms9Patch;assembly=Forms9Patch\" xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:LinkTest\" x:Class=\"LinkTest.MainPage\"> <ContentPage.Padding> <OnPlatform x:TypeArguments=\"Thickness\"> <On Platform=\"iOS\" Value=\"20, 40, 20, 20\" /> <On Platform=\"Android, WinPhone, Windows\" Value=\"20\" /> </OnPlatform> </ContentPage.Padding> <StackLayout VerticalOptions=\"Center\"> <Forms9Patch:Label HorizontalTextAlignment=\"Center\"> Example of Forms9Patch markup text. </Forms9Patch:Label> <BoxView HeightRequest=\"1\" Color=\"Black\"></BoxView> <Forms9Patch:Label x:Name=\"PhoneLabel\" HorizontalTextAlignment=\"Center\" TextColor=\"Black\"> <![CDATA[This is a phone number link: <a id=\"link1\" href=\"tel:+353015546889\">015546889</a> ]]> </Forms9Patch:Label> <BoxView HeightRequest=\"1\" Color=\"Black\"></BoxView> <Forms9Patch:Label x:Name=\"EmailLabel\" HorizontalTextAlignment=\"Center\" TextColor=\"Black\"> <![CDATA[This is an email link: <a id=\"link2\" href=\"mailto:email@hotmail.com\">email@hotmail.com</a> ]]> </Forms9Patch:Label> </StackLayout> </ContentPage> Modify your share code's MainPage source code ( MainPage.xaml.cs ) using the following code so it will respond to clicks / taps on the Forms9Patch.Label action links. using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Xamarin.Forms; using Xamarin.Forms.Xaml; namespace LinkTest { public partial class MainPage : ContentPage { public MainPage() { InitializeComponent(); PhoneLabel.ActionTagTapped += ActionTagTapped; EmailLabel.ActionTagTapped += ActionTagTapped; } private void ActionTagTapped(object sender, Forms9Patch.ActionTagEventArgs e) { Forms9Patch.Toast.Create(\"Link Activated\", \"The link (id: \" + e.Id + \", href:\" + e.Href + \") was activated.\"); } } } Modify your shared code's App source code ( App.xaml.cs ) using the following code so your app will allow the use of Forms9Patch Popups. using System; using Xamarin.Forms; using Xamarin.Forms.Xaml; [assembly: XamlCompilation(XamlCompilationOptions.Compile)] namespace LinkTest { public partial class App : Application { public App() { InitializeComponent(); MainPage = Forms9Patch.RootPage.Create(new MainPage()); } } } By wrapping the new MainPage() in a Forms9Patch.RootPage.Create() method, Forms9Patch establishes the necessary anchor in your app's visual tree to enable it to support pop-ups. IMPORTANT ANDROID INSTRUCTION: In order for the Android platform project to build, you will need to add an Android string resource for Forms9Patch's copy authority. Double click on the LinkTest.Droid project in the Solution Pad (left) to open the Android platform project's Project Options dialog.

    "title": "Using Forms9Patch.Image | Forms9Patch",
    "keywords": "Using Forms9Patch.Image Forms9Patch.Image extends Xamarin.Forms.Image to provide Xamarin.Forms with a patch scalable image element, the ability to tile an image within its alloted bounds, and the rendering of SVG images. The ImageSource for the Forms9Patch.Image element can be specified either as a Forms9Patch.ImageSource or a Xamarin.Forms.ImageSource . Supported file formats are NinePatch ( .9.png ), .png , .jpg , .jpeg , .gif , .bmp , .bmpf , and .svg . Background iOS's UIKit provides resizableImageWithCapInsets: to make an UIImage a patch scalable image. The capInset argument is used to specify the regions (distance inset from the edges) which will not scale (or scale in only one direction) when the image is stretched to fill it's parent view. Similarly, Android provides NinePatchDrawable to allow apps to display Nine-patch images as scalable drawing elements. The Nine-patch image format is used to specify the regions that are allowed to scale when the image is stretched to fill it's parent view. Both approaches have their advantages. Unlike iOS's resizableImageWithCapInsets: , Android's and Forms9Patch's use of the Nine-patch image format allows for unscalable regions to be anywhere in the image (not just at the edges). And, because the scaled regions are marked within the image file, scaling can be customized to each file. On the other hand, resizableImageWithCapInsets: provides the ability to define the scaling regions at runtime - which provides additional flexibility and convenience. Seeing advantages to each approach, Forms9Patch.Image allows for both. If a NinePatch image is provided, Forms9Patch.Image uses it's scalable region marking. If the CapsInset property is set, Forms9Patch.Image will use it to set the unscalable edges - which means CapsInset will always override NinePatch regions. `## Xamarin.Forms.Image.Aspect vs. Forms9Patch.Image.Fill Xamarin.Forms.Image provides the Aspect property to indicate how an image will fill its bounds. Forms9Patch.Image does not support the Aspect property. Rather, it has the Fill property. The Fill property supports the Aspect property's AspectFill , AspectFit , and Fill values and adds the Tile value for easy management of textures. See the Forms9PatchDemo app for examples of it in action. NinePatch image example Let's describe the use of Forms9Patch.Image for NinePatch images through an example. Say you want to display a pop-up message bubble where the tip is centered. Because they can have multiple scalable regions, the Nine-patch format works great for this. Starting with a .png of the bubble, use a NinePatch editor, like Android's Draw 9-patch to mark the horizontal and vertical stretchable regions. Before marking After marking bubble.png bubble.9.png 200x122 202x124 After adding bubble.9.png to your cross-platform project as an EmbeddedResource, you can display it using something like the following: var bubbleImage = new Forms9Patch.Image () { Source = ImageSource.FromResource(\"MyDemoApp.Resources.bubble.9.png\"), HeightRequest = 110, } var label = new label () { Text = \"Forms9Path NinePatch Image\", HorizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center, } Resulting in: CapsInset Property Coding the CapsInset Property The CapInset property is used to specify the regions (distance inset from the edges) which will not scale when the image is stretched to fill it's parent view. For example, let's make the following image a banner by scaling it horizontally. ResourceID: MyDemoApp.Resources.Images.redribbon.png Image Size: 308x80 Load it using Xamarin.Forms.ImageSource as the source to Forms9Patch.Image and then, set the CapInsets property: var label1 = new Label () { Text = \"Xamarin Image\", } var image1 = new Xamarin.Forms.Image () { Source = ImageSource.FromResource(\"MyDemoApp.Resources.Images.redribbon.png\"), } var label1 = new Label () { Text = \"Forms9Patch Image w/ CapInsets\", } var image2 = new Forms9Patch.Image () { Source = ImageSource.FromResource(\"MyDemoApp.Resources.Images.redribbon.png\"), CapInsets = new Thickness(23, 0, 110, 0), } iPhone Android XAML Example for CapsInset To use Forms9Patch.Image in your XAML, you will have to add the Forms9Patch namespace (from the Forms9Patch assembly) and then use Forms9Patch.Image where desired. Also note that, if you want to use Embedded Resource images, you will need to add an XAML markup extension to the assembly that contains those images (see Using Forms9Patch.ImageSource ). For example: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <ContentPage xmlns=\"http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms\" xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml\" xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:MyXamlDemo;assembly=MyXamlDemo\" xmlns:Forms9Patch=\"clr-namespace:Forms9Patch;assembly=Forms9Patch\" x:Class=\"MyXamlDemo.MyPage\" Padding=\"5, 20, 5, 5\"> <ScrollView> <ScrollView.Content> <StackLayout> <Label Text=\"Xamarin.Forms.Image\"/> <Image Source=\"{local:ImageMultiResource Forms9PatchDemo.Resources.Images.redribbon}\"/> <Label Text=\"Forms9Patch.Image w/ CapInsets\"/> <Forms9Patch:Image Source=\"{local:ImageMultiResource Forms9PatchDemo.Resources.Images.redribbon}\" CapInsets=\"23,-1,111,-1\"/> </StackLayout> </ScrollView.Content> </ScrollView> </ContentPage> Embedded Resource Convenience Constructor If you do most of your layouts in code (rather than XAML), there are tasks you repeat very often. And because they are repeated so often, a shorter version of that task would be convenient. If you often use Forms9Patch.ImageSource.FromMultiResource , Forms9Patch.ImageSource.FromResource , or Xamarin.Forms.ImageSource.FromResource as the source for your Forms9Patch.Image or Xamarin.Forms.Image , you will be happy to know that you can instead pass the EmbeddedResourceId as an parameter to the Forms9Patch.Image constructor. var image = new Forms9Patch.Image(\"Forms9PatchDemo.Resources.Images.redribbon\"); Fill Property Forms9Patch.Image.Fill property is almost identical to Xamarin.Forms.Image.Aspect property. It is only different in that it uses Forms9Patch.Fill instead of Xamarin.Forms.Aspect - which means it also supports Forms9Patch.Fill.Tile to direct Forms9Patch.Image to tile a source image in the image layout. TintColor Property There are times where it is desireable to theme an app at runtime. One way of doing this is by changing the color of monochrome images (often used as icons). Forms9Patch makes this easy by giving Forms9Patch.Image the TintColor property. var image = new Forms9Patch.Image(\"MyApp.Resource.Printer.png\") { TintColor = Color.Blue }; Source Image w/ TintColor=Color.Blue Note: The TintColor property is intented for use with raster images that have and makes use of the transparent color plane. Results will likely be undesireable for other types of raster images. This property is ignored for vector ( .svg ) images. SourceImageSize Property Want to be sure you got the image you intended to ask for? This question can come up when you're doing cross platform development. The SourceImageSize property can help with this by giving you the size of the ImageSource being used for the image. NOTE: For NinePatch images ( .9.png ), the value returned does not include the two extra pixels in width and height for the NinePatch markup. AntiAlias Property Xamarin.Forms relies on the platform image elements to render images. A small performance improvement can be had by not applying an anti-alias algorithm to the image during rendering. Just as Xamarin.Forms , Forms9Patch.Image preforms this anti-alias step by default. However, if you're upscaling an image a bit much and you don't care about some pixalization, then you want a little more performance by setting this property to true . BackgroundColor Property What? Why would an image need a background color? Well, usually it wouldn't but images with transparent regions ( .png and .svg ) create an opportunity. Just as you can use the TintColor to theme a monocrome raster image, you can use BackgroundColor to them the transparent regions of such an image. Cool, huh? Source image BackgroundColor=Color.Orange Note the corners are rounded on this image! Outline and Shape Properties Taking things a step further than we did with the BackgroundColor property, why not be able to continue to dress up the image? Clipping an image to a shape and/or adding a border are two common operations applied to images when they are used as app assets. Since this is so common, Forms9Patch has them built-in. To set the shape, use the ElementShape property (which takes a Forms9Patch.ElementShape value). Available values are: ElementShape Description Full Bleed Image Exmaple Rectangle pretty much the same as \"don't clip\" Square clip the longest side to be the same length as the shortest side Circle because, circle clipped head shots are so 2015 Ellipse still waiting for this one to be cool Obround it's embarrassing how long it took me to find out there was a name for this shape And, if you used Xamarin.Forms.Frame before, Forms9Patch's Outline properties will seem familiar: Property Description Transparent PNG Example OutlineColor Color of Forms9Patch ElementShape's outline OutlineWidth Width of Forms9Patch ElementShape's outline OutlineRadius Forms9Patch Element's corner radius. Only applies to Rectangle and Square shapes HasShadow and ShadowInverted Properties Let's go out on limb and keep adding embelishments to the image. Once you have the ability to impose a shape to your image, it is common to want a shadow to match the imposed shape. HasShadow makes that happen. And, going even further, ShadowInverted reverses the shadow to give a recessed effect to the shadow. Now, here is where Forms9Patch can do something a bit clever. If the ImageSource is a *.png image with transparency in the image, the HasShadow property of Forms9Patch will impose the shadow on the overlap of the ElementShape and the non-transparent parts of the image! NOTE: Setting ShadowInverted to true breaks this functionality."

    "keywords": "Using Forms9Patch.ImageSource Xamarin Forms implmentation of resolution specific image sourcing relies upon native APIs and schema for iOS, Android, and Windows UWP multi-screen image management described here . This requires storing your iOS images in your iOS platform project using the native iOS schema, storing your Android images in your Android platform project using the Android native schema, and storing your UWP images in your UWP platform project using the UWP native schema. In other words, duplicative efforts to get the same results on both Android, iOS, and UWP. Forms9Patch.ImageSource simplifies Xamarin.Forms.ImageSource capabilities by bringing multi-screen image management to your Shared Library, PCL Assemblies, and .NetStandard projects - so you only have to generate and configure your app's image resources once. Embedded Resource Id Naming Convention To use Forms9Patch multi-platform image management, you will need to store your image resource files as Embedded Resources. You can do this by: VisualStudio Mac : Right clicking on image file and selecting Build Action / EmbeddedResource VisualStudio 2017 : Right clicking on the image file and selecting Properties and then, in the \"Properties\" panel, modify the Build Action field to EmbeddedResource Each embedded resources has an EmbeddedResourceId string that is used to reference it at runtime. An EmbeddedResourceId is a sequence of strings joined by a period (.)as a separator. This series of strings starts with the assembly name for the project in which the embedded resource is in, appended by the names of each folder in that project's folder structure for the embedded resource file, and ends with the embedded resource's file name. project_assembly_name.project_path.base_image_file_name.extension For example, if your project's assembly name is PizzaMaker and has an image file named slice.png in its Resources/Images folder, the EmbeddedResourceId of that file would be PizzaMaker.Resources.Images.slice.png . If you're using VisualStudio Mac, don't worry too much about this because the EmbeddedResourceId is in the Properties panel in the ResourceID field. You can find the Properties panel for a file by, in the Solution Explorer pad, right clicking on a file and selecting Properties . To facilitate runtime selection (for device resolution and type) between multiple renditions of an image, Forms9Patch prescribes how to name each rendition of your image files (and thus their EmbeddedResourceId). File Name : base_image_name[resolution_modifier][device_modifier].extension EmbeddedResourceId : project_assembly_name.project_path.base_image_name[resolution_modifier][device_modifier].extension Notice the addition of the optional [resolution_modifier] and [device_modifier] modifiers. These modifiers will be familiar to iOS developers. Likewise, Android developers can see analogs in Android's Resources sub-folder naming conventions. Valid values for the optional modifiers are: Resolution Modifiers Forms9Patch notes iOS analog Android analog none fallback image if no other is available none (default) none (default) @¾x low density screens (~120 dpi) n/a -ldpi @1x explicit medium density (~160 dpi) none (default) -mdpi @1½x (~240 dpi) n/a -hdpi @2x most common (~320) @2x -xhdpi @3x rare (~480 dpi) @3x -xxhdpi @4x future proof (~640 dpi) @4x -xxxhdpi Device Modifiers Forms9Patch notes iOS analog Android analog none fallback image if no other is available none (default) none (default) ~phone maps to Xamarin Forms' TargetIdiom.Phone ~iPhone none (default) ~tablet maps to Xamarin Forms' TargetIdiom.Tablet ~iPad sw600dp ~desktop maps to Xamarin Forms' TargetIdiom.Desktop n/a n/a ~tv maps to Xamarin Forms' TargetIdiom.TV n/a n/a ~unsupported maps to Xamarin Forms' TargetIdiom.Unsupported n/a n/a Forms9Patch.ImageSource Now that you've saved your image files for each device type and resolution rendition you want to support, next comes using those images in your app. This is where Forms9Patch.ImageSource comes in. Forms9Patch.ImageSource extends Xamarin.Forms.ImageSource by adding the FromMultiResource static method, adding the following functionality to Xamarin.Forms.ImageSource.FromResource: Finds the best fit image among the EmbeddedResource image renditions Eliminates the need for explicitly specifying the image file's extension This is not without compromise. Because Xamarin.Forms.ImageSource.FromResource is intended to be multi-platform, it only supports the following image file formats: NinePatch ( .9.png ), .png , .jpg , .jpeg , .gif , .bmp , .bmpf and .svg . Note that, unlike the other image file formats, NinePatch and .svg images can only be used with Forms9Patch image elements. Code Example The following is a very simple app to demonstrate how Forms9Patch.ImageSource uses Forms9Patch's Embedded Resource ResourceID naming convention to provide the best Embedded Resource image to Xamarin.Forms.Image or Forms9Patch.Image. First, we start with a set of multi-device / multi-resolution images: 50x50 100x100 150x150 image.png image@2x.png image@3x.png image~tablet.png image@2x~tablet.png image@3x~tablet.png Next, we create our app: Create a new Xamarin Forms cross-platform (.Netstandard or PCL) application named MyDemoApp with the MyDemoApp assembly namespace Create a Resources directory in the app's cross-platform project (the .NetStandard or PCL project) Save the above six images in the cross-platform project's Resources directory Set the Build Action to EmbeddedResource for those images Modify your app code MyDemoApp.cs as shown, below: Forms9Patch.ImageSource.FromMultiResource will choose among the available embedded resource renditions in the cross-platform assembly and select the rendition that works best with the current device (tablet or phone; low / medium / high resolution). XAML Example In Xamarin.Forms, access to embedded resources from XAML requires some additional work. Unfortunately, Forms9Patch is no different. As with Xamarin.Forms, you will need (in the same assembly as your embedded resource images) a simple custom XAML markup extension to load images using their ResourceID. [ContentPropert (\"Source\")] public class ImageMultiResourceExtension : IMarkupExtension { public string Source { get; set; } public object ProvideValue (IServiceProvider serviceProvider) { if (Source == null) return null; // Do your translation lookup here, using whatever method you require var imageSource = Forms9Patch.ImageSource.FromMultiResource(Source); return imageSource; } } Once you have the above, you can load your embedded resource images as shown in the below example. Be sure to add a namespace to your XAML for the assembly that contains both the above MarkupExtension and your EmbeddedResources (named local in the below example). <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <ContentPage xmlns=\"http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms\" xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml\" xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:MyXamlDemo;assembly=MyXamlDemo\" x:Class=\"MyXamlDemo.MyPage\" Padding=\"5, 20, 5, 5\"> <ScrollView> <ScrollView.Content> <StackLayout> <Label Text=\"Xamarin.Image\"/> <Image Source=\"{local:ImageMultiResource Forms9PatchDemo.Resources.image}\"/> </StackLayout> </ScrollView.Content> </ScrollView> </ContentPage>"

    "title": "Forms9Patch Label Element | Forms9Patch",
    "keywords": "Forms9Patch Label Element Background I wrote the Forms9Patch.Label element to solve a couple of problems: EmbeddedResource, Custom Fonts Setting up to use custom fonts with Xamarin.Forms is very painful - and not at all in the spirit of cross platform. I wish Xamarin had made using custom fonts easier because I would rather be making apps than making libraries. But, alas, that's not (yet) the case. If you're at Xamarin and are reading this, please don't take it personally - I love Xamarin Forms and wouldn't be putting in this much effort if I didn't. As with images, it seems that the idea cross-platform approach to custom fonts would be to embed them (as EmbeddedResources) in the shared, cross platform code. That wasn't trivial and there were a lot of obstacles to overcome. Once worked out, I saw it was possible to bring this font management magic back to Xamarin.Forms elements via the Forms9Patch.EmbeddedResourceFontEffect . Just to clarify, Forms9Patch text elements ( Label and buttons) supports EmbeddedResource custom fonts without modification. Xamarin.Forms text elements ( Label and Button ) can also use EmbeddedResource custom fonts by adding the Forms9Patch.EmbeddedResourceFontEffect effect. Detailed Examples: Adding your custom font as an Embedded Resource Embedded Resource custom font with Forms9Patch.Label Embedded Resource custom fonts with Xamarin.Forms text elements + EmbeddedResourceFontEffect Intra-Label Text Formatting Text formating shouldn't be painful. That's why HTML and MarkDown were invented. Although Xamarin uses a fairly conventional approach (intermediate Span elements), it certainly isn't an easy approach. Both iOS and Android have some HTML markup capability, natively. However, the philosophy behind Forms9Patch is to avoid native if there is a NetStandard, PCL, or Shared Library approach that is easier and just as fast. Forms9Patch avoids the use of intermediate elements. Instead, you to pass HTML directly to the Label or button elements by way of the HtmlText property. Also, the HtmlText property supports a larger range of formatting than Xamarin provides via the Span element. Additionally, HtmlText integrates Forms9Patch's Embedded Resource Custom Font support into its HTML markup to give you the power to easily apply custom fonts on a granular level. Automatically Resizing Text (Auto-fitting) Something very important to me is the ability to resize a label's FontSize so the label can fit its container without truncation - or having more control over the layout before truncation happens. At the time of this writing, Xamarin's recommendation for this is \"build a custom renderer\". Which is what I did. Before starting, I reviewed what I already knew: Apple and Android has some provisions for auto-fitting. But neither addressed all the use cases I've faced. So, Forms9Patch's Label's auto-fitting had to do more. Oversimplifying things: If the bounds (width and height) of the label are imposed upon it then auto-fitting should scale the font to fit those bounds. If the width of the label is imposed upon it then auto-fitting should scale the label's height. But that is an oversimplification. The Lines , FontSize , and AutoFit properties play an important role and determining just how Forms9Patch's auto-fitting works. To better explain this, lets look at the imposed bounds and imposed width cases separately. Once the autofitting is completed, Forms9Patch updates Label 's read only ActualFontSize property with the resulting font size. And, in case you were wondering: Why is there no autofitting when the width is not imposed? Because then the text should all fit on one line. Autofit: How it works Source code for the below examples can be found in LabelAutofitPage.cs of the Forms9PatchDemo project GitHub repository . Imposed Bounds Autofitting So what is meant by Imposed Bounds ? If the bounds of the Label is either requested (using WidthRequest and/or HeightRequest ) and/or is limited by the bounds of its parent container element (the Label 's content is greater than the space available), then Forms9Patch says the Label 's bounds is imposed . If the Label' s bounds are imposed, then you can choose its autofitting behavior using the following property settings: Property Setting(s) Result GIF Lines=0 Scale the font size of the text until it either fits within the bounds, limiting the font size between MinFontSizeand and FontSize . This is the default setting. Lines>0 AutoFit=AutoFit.None Scale the font size of the text until Lines lines fits the Label's Height , limiting the font size between FontSize and MinFontSize . If the text cannot fit within Lines lines or the imposed height, apply the LineBreakMode truncation. Lines>0 AutoFit=AutoFit.Width Scale the font size of the text until it all fits within Lines lines, limiting the font size between FontSize and MinFontSize . If limited to MinFontSize , apply the LineBreakMode truncation. Lines>0 AutoFit=AutoFit.Lines Scale the font size of the text until Lines lines fits the Label's Height, limiting the font size between FontSize and MinFontSize . If the text cannot fit within Lines lines, apply the LineBreakMode truncation. Imposed Width Autofitting Autofitting works differently if the Label 's width has been imposed but the height has not. In this scenario, the goal is to scale the height to match text at the given FontSize or the given AutoFit and Line values. The table below describes how imposed width autofitting behavior is controlled by the related property settings: Property Setting(s) Result GIF Lines=0 Scale the height of the Label to fit the text at the current FontSize . This is the default setting. Lines>0 AutoFit=AutoFit.None Scale the height of the Label so that it is as tall as the smaller of either Lines lines at FontSize or the complete text body at FontSize . If the text cannot fit within Lines lines, apply the LineBreakMode truncation. Lines>0 AutoFit=AutoFit.Width Scale the height of the Label and the font size of the text until it all fits within Lines lines, limiting the font size between FontSize and MinFontSize . If limited to MinFontSize , apply the LineBreakMode truncation. Lines>0 Fit=LabelFit.Lines Scale the height of the Label so that it is as tall as Lines lines at FontSiz e. If the text cannot fit within Lines lines, apply the LineBreakMode truncation. HTML Markup: How it works Both iOS and Android have some HTML markup capability, natively. However, the philosophy behind Forms9Patch is to avoid native if there is a NetStandard approach that is easier and just as fast. Forms9Patch does this by avoiding the use of intermediate classes and, instead, allows you to pass HTML directly to its Label , Segment , and Button elements by way of the HtmlText property. Also, HtmlText property supports a larger range of formatting than Xamarin provides via the Span element. Additionaly, HtmlText integrates Forms9Patch's Embedded Resource Custom Font support into its HTML markup to give you the power to easily apply custom fonts on a granular level. Supported Tags <a> Anchor (Action), formatted as a hyperlink. The text surrounded by this tag will look like a hyperlink. When this text is tapped on, it will trigger Label's event EventHandler<ActionTagEventArgs>> ActionTagTapped event. The ActionTagTapped event will pass object sender (the Label element) and ActionTagEventArgs e (with, you guessed it, two parameters: Id and Href ). Attributes: id a first string to identify the action href a second string to further identify the action <big> Big <b> Bold <del> Delete <den> Denominator <em> Emphesis <font> Font. Attributes: face : font family (supports native, \"Monospace\", \"San-serif\", \"Serif\", and Embedded Resource custom fonts) size : font size (in \"px\", \"em\", and \"%\" units, HTML 1-7 unitless, HTML relative, and HTML named sizes ) color : font color (in rgb, rgba, hex, and HTML named colors) <ins> Insert <i> Italic <num> Numerator <pre> Prefomatted (Monospace font with white space preserved) <s> Stikethrough <small> Small <strike> Strikethrough <strong> Strong <sub> Subscript <sup> Superscript <tt> Teletype <u> Underline Attributes Only the style attribute is supported at this time. style : Style applied within tag limits. Parameters: background-color : Background color. (in rgb, rgba, hex, and HTML named colors) color : Font (foreground) color. (in rgb, rgba, hex, and HTML named colors) font-family : Font family (supports native, \"Monospace\", \"San-serif\", \"Serif\", and Embedded Resource custom fonts) font-size : font size (in \"px\", \"em\", and \"%\" units, HTML 1-7 unitless, HTML relative, and HTML named sizes ) font-weight : Set to bold to apply bold to the text. Only bold is supported at this time and only on fonts there a bold subset is available. It is recommended to use the <b> tag instead. font-style : Set to italic to apply italics formatting to the text. Only italic is supported at this time and only on fonts where an italic subset is available. It is recommended to use the <i> tag instead. XAML Exmaple: HTML Markup Follow one of the below Getting Started guides to create a .NetStandard Xamarin Forms cross-platform app with the MyDemoApp assembly namespace. Getting Started: VisualStudio 2017 for Mac Getting Started: VisualStudio 2017 for Windows Create a Resources folder in the app's shared code (.NetStandard) project: Right click on your .NetStandard project and select Add / New Folder . A New Folder folder should appear. Rename it Resources . Before After Create a Fonts folder under the Resources folder in the app's shared code (.NetStandard) project Save the MaterialIcons-Regular.ttf custom font file to the Resources/Fonts folder. I prefer to drag it from OSX Finder or Windows File Explorer into the Resources/Fonts folder in VisualStudio. Set the Build Action to EmbeddedResource for this custom font. Make note of the Resource ID of this custom font. See Embedded Resource Id Naming Convention for details. Your Embedded Resource custom font is now ready for use by Forms9Patch label and button elements and for any Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement that supports the FontFamily property. Add a \"Forms ContentPage Xaml\" file to your .NetStandard project: Right click on your PCL project (MyDemoApp) Select **Add / \"New File ** The New File dialog box should appear. Select Forms ContentPage Xaml , enter a name ( HtmlTextPage ), and click the [New] button. You should now have two new files open in Xamarin Studio: HtmlTextPage.xaml (a skeleton Xaml page) and its code behind, HtmlTextPage.xaml.cs . Add the Forms9Patch namespace to your XAML Open the HtmlTestPage.xaml file. Add the xmlns:f9p=\"clr-namespace:Forms9Patch;assembly=Forms9Patch\" attribute to the <ContentPage> tag. Add the XAML Layout Add the Padding=\"40 and BackgroundColor=\"Silver\" attributes to the <ContentPage> tag. Add the following Forms9Patch.Label and Forms9Patch.SegmentedControl elements to a Xamarin.Forms.StackLayout as the ContentPage 's content: <StackLayout> <Label Text=\"HTML Markuped Label Examples\" TextColor=\"Black\" FontAttributes=\"Bold\" /> <f9p:Label TextColor=\"Black\"> <![CDATA[plain <b>bold</b> <i>italic</i>]]]> </f9p:Label> <f9p:SegmentedControl BackgroundColor=\"White\" FontSize=\"16\" FontColor=\"#0076FF\" Orientation=\"Vertical\" OutlineColor=\"#CCC\" OutlineWidth=\"0\" SeparatorWidth=\"1\" OutlineRadius=\"6\" Padding=\"5\"> <f9p:Segment><![CDATA[Pause <b>5</b>]]></f9p:Segment> <f9p:Segment><![CDATA[Pause <b>10</b>]]></f9p:Segment> <f9p:Segment><![CDATA[Pause <b>15</b>]]></f9p:Segment> <f9p:Segment Text=\"Cancel\" FontColor=\"Red\"/> <f9p:Segment HtmlText=\"&lt;s&gt;Launch&lt;/s&gt;\" FontAttributes=\"Bold\" IsEnabled=\"false\"> <![CDATA[<s>Launch</s>]]]> </f9p:Segment> </f9p:SegmentedControl> </StackLayout> Make HtmlTestPage your apps MainPage. Open your .NetStandard project's Application subclass ( MyDemoApp.cs in this example). Set the MainPage property to new HtmlTestPage() Build and start your app"

    "title": "Using Forms9Patch's Layouts | Forms9Patch",
    "keywords": "Using Forms9Patch's Layouts Just as Xamarin.Forms.Frame extends Xamarin.Forms.ContentView by adding the OutlineColor and HasShadow properties, Forms9Patch.AbsoluteLayout , Forms9Patch.Frame , Forms9Patch.Grid , Forms9Patch.RelativeLayout and Forms9Patch.Stacklayout extends their Xamarin.Forms counterparts with those two properties and adds the BackgroundImage , ElementShape , OutlineWidth , OutlineRadius , OutlineColor and ShadowInverted properties. In otherwords, everything you can do to decorate a Forms9Patch.Image , you can do to decorate Forms9Patch's layouts. Additionally, the Forms9Patch layouts have the IgnoreChildren property as a way to improve app responsiveness. When a child element is updated, it kicks off a measurement and layout cycle that can propogate up through the view hierarchy - potentially consuming a lot of CPU. I'm looking at you, Xamarin.Forms.Android! Sometimes this is necessary in order to make room for or reclaim room from the updated child element. However, there a lot of instances where the updated child will never have an impact upon the rest of the view hierarchy - other than slowing everything down while Xamarin Forms goes through the measure-layout cycle. For example, if you have a Grid with fixed (GridUnitType.Absolute) or proportional (GridUnitType.Star) sized rows and columns then any change to a child will not change the Grid's layout. So, to keep an update of a child from propogating up the view hierarchy, set the IgnoreChildren property to true. Please note that this is a \"running with sissors\" feature that should be used carefully. Background Image Code Example Here we are going to create a Forms9Patch.ContentView , set a background image, and have a label for Content . new Forms9Patch.ContentView { BackgroundImage = new Forms9Patch.Image { Source = Forms9Patch.ImageSource.FromMultiResource (\"Forms9PatchDemo.Resources.redribbon\"), Fill = Forms9Patch.Fill.Tile, CapInsets = new Thickness(30,-1,160,-1), }, Content = new Xamarin.Forms.Label { Text = \"ContentView scalable (CapInsets)\", TextColor = Color.White, FontAttributes = FontAttributes.Bold, FontSize = 14, HorizontalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center, VerticalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center, }, Padding = new Thickness(30,30,110,20), HeightRequest = 80, }, iOS Android XAML Example As discussed earlier , using Embedded Resource images in XAML requires the use of a XAML markup extension in your view's namespace. Assuming such an extension has been setup, the following demonstrates how to use Forms9Patch.ContentView in XAML. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <ContentPage xmlns=\"http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms\" xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml\" xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:MyXamlDemo;assembly=MyXamlDemo\" xmlns:Forms9Patch=\"clr-namespace:Forms9Patch;assembly=Forms9Patch\" x:Class=\"MyXamlDemo.MyPage\" Padding=\"5, 20, 5, 5\"> <f9p:ContentView Padding=\"30,30,110,20\" HeightRequest=\"80\"/> <f9p:ContentView.BackgroundImage> <f9p:Image Source=\"{local:ImageMultiResource Forms9PatchDemo.Resources.redribbon}\" CapInsets=\"23,-1,111,-1\" /> </f9p:ContentView.BackgroundImage> <Label Text=\"Forms9Patch.Image w/ CapInsets\" TextColor=\"White\" HorizontalOptions=\"Center\" VerticalOptions=\"Center\" FontSize=\"14\" /> </f9p:ContentView> </ContentPage> Outline & Shadow Code Example var frame = new Forms9Patch.Frame { Content = new Xamarin.Forms.Label { Text = \"Frame OutlineRadius & Shadow\", TextColor = Color.Black, FontSize = 12, }, Padding = new Thickness(10), Background = Color.FromHex( 12), OutlineRadius = 2, HasShadow = true, } iOS Android XAML Example <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <ContentPage xmlns=\"http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms\" xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml\" xmlns:local=\"clr-namespace:MyXamlDemo;assembly=MyXamlDemo\" xmlns:Forms9Patch=\"clr-namespace:Forms9Patch;assembly=Forms9Patch\" x:Class=\"MyXamlDemo.MyPage\" Padding=\"5, 20, 5, 5\"> <StackLayout> <f9p:Frame Padding=\"20\" OutlineColor=\"Blue\" OutlineWidth=\"3\" OutlineRadius=\"10\" BackgroundColor=\"Gray\" /> <Label Text=\"Forms9Patch.Frame w/ OutlineWidth+OutlineRadius\" TextColor=\"White\" HorizontalOptions=\"Center\" VerticalOptions=\"Center\" FontSize=\"14\" /> </f9p:Frame> </StackLayout> </ContentPage> iOS Android"

    "href": "guides/Popups.html",
    "title": "Forms9Patch Popups | Forms9Patch",
    "keywords": "Forms9Patch Popups Yet another thing missing from Xamarin Forms is a comprehensive set of popup views. Forms9Patch has a seven (ModalPopup, BubblePopup, Toast, TargetedToast, PermissionPopup, ActivityInditorPopup and TargetedMenu) popups to simplify the most common tasks. However, this comes at a price! In previous releases of Forms9Patch, I tried to implement the popups in a way that would require the least amount of prep work on your part. Unfortunately, this meant a lot very ugly code, performance penalties, and (to add insult to injury) the Android implementation of version 2.3 of Xamarin.Forms broke it for the Xamarin.Forms.MasterDetailPage . So, this part is IMPORTANT! Forms9Patch popups only work if your apps MainPage is a Forms9Patch.RootPage . Wait, DON'T PANIC! Forms9Patch.RootPage is just a wrapper for your app's pages. In other words, wrap page content you normally would set as its MainPage in an instance of Forms9Patch.RootPage . For example, if your app's instance of App is as follows (pay attention to line 25): NOTE: This is also important. Forms9Patch popups really don't work consistantly when presented in a descendent of a Page that has been pushed modally. I'm not sure why this is and just haven't had the time to look into this. One day! using Xamarin.Forms; namespace ExampleApp { public class App : Application { public App() { // The root page of your application var content = new ContentPage { Title = \"ExampleApp\", Content = new StackLayout { VerticalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center, Children = { new Label { HorizontalTextAlignment = TextAlignment.Center, Text = \"Welcome to Xamarin Forms!\" } } } }; MainPage = new NavigationPage(content); // before adding Forms9Patch popup support } } } You are going to want to change line 25 to: using Xamarin.Forms; namespace ExampleApp { public class App : Application { public App() { // The root page of your application var content = new ContentPage { Title = \"ExampleApp\", Content = new StackLayout { VerticalOptions = LayoutOptions.Center, Children = { new Label { HorizontalTextAlignment = TextAlignment.Center, Text = \"Welcome to Xamarin Forms!\" } } } }; MainPage = Forms9Patch.RootPage.Create(new NavigationPage(content)); // after adding Forms9Patch popup support } } } Common Properties, Methods and Events The following properties and methods are common to all Forms9Patch popups, except ActivityIndicatorPopup : Appearance Properties BackgroundImage : The Forms9Patch.Image displayed as the popup's background. BackgroundColor : popup's optional background color. OutlineColor : optional outline color. OutlineWidth : width of optional outline. OutlineRadius : outline's corner radius. HasShadow : one more time ... that actually works on Android. Has no effect when BackgroundColor has not been set. ShadowInverted : to apply a recessed effect to the layout (if HasShadow is enabled). Page Overlay (between the popup and the page the popup sets upon) Properties: PageOverlayColor : The Color of the page overlay upon which the ModalPopup sets. Default value is Color.Rgba(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5) . CancelOnBackgroundTouch : Controls is the popup is cancelled if the background is touched. Default value is true. Memory Management Properties: Retain : a boolean (default: false ) used to indicate if the popup and its contents should be removed from the view hierarchy as soon as the view is hidden. Why would I bother to have this? ANDROID! If you have a heavy layout that will be shown multiple times, you may not want to re-render each time it is made visible. Seeing Retain=true will keep your popup and its content in the view hierarchy so it won't have to be re-rendered the next time you want to present it. Methods void Cancel() : Programically cancels the Popup. Events Cancelled : Called when the popup has been canceled by the user tapping outside its bounds. Forms9Patch.ModelPopup The most needed missing component: a simple content popup that is a content container which centers its contents on the main page. Since you may want a popup container with a background image, Forms9Patch provides the ModalPopup element for this purpose. Once you have initialized a Forms9Patch popup view, set the IsVisible property to true to present it. Unique Properties Content : The Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement that will be the content for the popview. Layouts and Views are fair game. ElementShape : ElementShape.Rectangle , ElementShape.Square , ElementShape.Circle , ElementShape.Ellipse , and ElementShape.Obround . Controls the shape of both the border and the background clipping region. Forms9Patch.BubblePopup The popup that is missing from both Xamarin.Forms and Android is a pointer bubble popup - a popup that points to another element. Given a Target element, some Content to display, and an allowed PointerDirection , Forms9Patch.BubblePopup will best fit a popup bubble pointing the the Target . Note that, unlike the ModalPopup element, BubblePopup does not support the BackgroundImage nor ElementShape properties. If you do not specify the Target , BubblePopup will present its content in a ModalPopup . As with ModalPopup , once you have initialized a BubblePopup you will need to set the IsVisible property to true to present it. Unique Properties Content : The VisualElement that will be the content for the popview. Layouts and Views are fair game. Target : The Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement to which the bubble popup will point. PointerLength : how long is the pointer. PointerTipRadius : what is the radius of the pointer's tip? PointerDirection : what directions is the bubble popup allow to point? Type: PointerDirection PointerCornerRadius : what is the radius of the notch between the bubble's body and the pointer? Forms9Patch.Toast Sometimes you simply need to put a message up on the screen. Given some HTML formatted text and an HTML formatted title Toast will display them in a popup with an (optional but enabled by default) [OK] button. Toast is inherited from the ModalPopup element so it does support background images. Unlike ModalPopup , Toast has the Create(string title, string text) static method that will generate and present the toast. You can still manually construct and present a Toast by using its constructor and setting its IsVisible property to true. Unique Properties: Title : The title for the Toast. See HTML Markup for supported markup. Text : The text for the Toast. See HTML Markup for supported markup. ElementShape : ElementShape.Rectangle , ElementShape.Square , ElementShape.Circle , ElementShape.Ellipse , and ElementShape.Obround . Controls the shape of both the border and the background clipping region. Unique Methods: static Toast Create(string title, string text) : instantiates and presents a Toast . Forms9Patch.TargetedToast Just as Toast is a convenience version of ModalPopup , TargetedToast is a convenience version of BubblePopup . Given a Target as a Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement , a Title , some Text to display, and an allowed PointerDirection , Forms9Patch.TargetedToast will best fit a popup bubble pointing the the Target . Like BubblePopup element, BubblePopup does not support background images. If you do not specify the Target , it will present itself as a Toast . As with Toast , you can use the Create static method to instantiate and present a TargetedToast . Unique Properties: Title : The title for the Toast. See HTML Markup for supported markup. Text : The text for the Toast. See HTML Markup for supported markup. Target : The Xamarin.Forms.VisualElement to which the bubble popup will point. OkButtonColor : Background color for [OK] button. OkTextColor : Text color for [OK] button. OKText : Text for [OK] button. Set to null to remove the [OK] button from the popup. As noted above, you don't want this set to null when CancelOnBackgroundTouch is set to false . Unique Methods static TargetedToast Create(VisualElement target, string title, string text) : instantiates and presents a TargetedToast . Forms9Patch.PermissionPopup Sometimes you simply need to ask a yes/no question. Given some HTML formatted text and an HTML formatted title, PermissionPopup will display them in a popup with [OK] and [Cancel] buttons. PermissionPopup is inherited from the ModalPopup element so it does support background images. Unlike ModalPopup , PermissionPopup has the Create(string title, string text) static method that will generate and present the toast. You can still manually construct and present a PermissionPopup by using its constructor and setting its IsVisible property to true . Unlike Toast , the [OK] and [Cancel] buttons cannot be removed from the layout by setting their text to null. Unique Properties Title : The title for the Toast. See HTML Markup for supported markup. Text : The text for the Toast. See HTML Markup for supported markup. OkButtonColor : Background color for [OK] button. OkTextColor : Text color for [OK] button. OKText : Text for [OK] button. CancelButtonColor : Background color for [Cancel] button. CancelTextColor : Text color for [Cancel] button. CancelText : Text for [Cancel] button. Unique Methods: static PermissionPopup Create(string title, string text, string okText = \"OK\", string cancelText = \"Cancel\") : instantiates and presents a PermissionPopup . Unique Events: OkTapped : Called when the [OK] button has been tapped. Forms9Patch.TargetedMenu Sometimes you need a popup menu with a list of menu items. And, if there are more menu items than available room, the menu needs to have pagination. Forms9Patch.TargetedMenu combines SegmentedController 's use of a List<Segement> to define the menu items with features of TargetedToast to give this functionality. Unique Properties: Segments : a List of Forms9Patch.Segement elements that define the menu items. See Forms9Patch.Segment for how to set a segment's text and icons. FontSize : size of font to be used. TextColor : color of text for each menu item. SeparatorColor : color of separator line between menu items SeparatorWidth : thickess of separator line between menu items HapticEffect : if available on platform and enabled via HapticMode , what will be the haptic effect: None , platform's KeyClick effect, platform's Return key effect, or platforms Delete key effect? HapticMode : if available on platform, enable, disable, or use default behaviour for the haptic effect. Unique Events: public event SegmentedControlEventHandler SegmentTapped : fired when a menu item (segment) has been tapped. Forms9Patch.ActivityIndicatorPopup This popup is propably misnamed. Its purpose is to present an activity indicator and block interaction with the app. Because ModalPopup had everything I needed to build this, I named it a popup. Probably should have thought about that more. Also, because this is something you typically just want to fire and forget, like Toast and TargetedToast , ActivityIndicatorPopup has a Create static method to instantiate and present an instance in one call. Note that Properties: PageOverlayColor : The Color of the page overlay upon which the ModalPopup sets. Default value is Color.Rgba(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5) . Color : Color of the activity indicator. CancelOnBackgroundTouch : Controls is the popup is cancelled if the background is touched. Default value is true. Methods static ActivityIndicatorPopup Create() void Cancel() : Programically cancels the popup. Events Cancelled : Called when the popup has been canceled by the user tapping outside its bounds."

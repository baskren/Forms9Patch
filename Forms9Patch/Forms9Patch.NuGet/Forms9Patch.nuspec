	<description>
Xamarin Forms is great for developing apps on Android, iOS, and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) but it is missing some important features: 
- Scalable images
- NetStandard, PCL and Shared Library, multi-screen / multi-resolution image management
- HTML formatted text for labels and buttons
- NetStandard, PCL and Shared Library custom font management
- Hardware keyboard key detection
- On-Screen software keyboard height change events
- Support for multiple items of the same MIME type on the clipboard
- Support for inter-app Data Sharing

Android developers can use NinePatch bitmaps, the drawable directory naming convention, Html.FromHtml, and a bunch of complex file manipulations to address the image issue.  Likewise, iOS developers can use ResizeableImageWithCapInsets, the @2x, @3x, @4x file naming convention, and some 3rd party libraries for this purpose.  Forms9Patch enhances Xamarin Forms to make multi-resolution / multi-screen image management, custom fonts, and HTML text formatting easy for NetStandard, PCL, and Shared Libary apps for iOS,  Android and UWP
  </description>
  <summary>Simplify multi-device image, label and font management in your NetStandard, PCL, and Shared Library Xamarin.Forms mobile and UWP apps</summary>
	<releaseNotes>
    1.8.0.2: Fixed: Label causes crash on older versions of iOS when default FontSize is used;
    1.8.0.1: Added Xamarin.Android.Support.Core.Utils dependency to NuSpec; Added XF4.0 Android dependencies to NuSpec;
    1.8.0.0: New: Built for Xamarin.Forms 4; FlyoutPopup can be cancelled with Swipe gesture; TargetedMenu now supports Vertical Orientation; Buttons, by default, have IsLongPressEnabled=false (for faster response); Added IconFontFamily to TargetedMenu;  Fixed: Intermittant failure to render labels when in ListView; HardwareKeyPage not working in Xamarin.Forms.Shell; Empty Label.Text causes crash; Not all FormsGestures working on all Xamarin.Forms elements; Rendering of ListView becomes slower and slower when cell content is changed; Label is truncated in some edge cases (Android); ModalPopup does not respond to WidthRequest or HeightRequest; ListView crash because Xamarin.Forms.ScrollView is disposed pre-maturely (thanks Xamarin!); SegmentedControl returning IsTruncated when it isn't; First display of picker may have scroll position in wrong place; Crash because LabelRenderer.Control or LabelRenderer.Element is null; Crash when trying to get the location of a view that has not yet been rendered; Crash when FormsGestures is called on a disposed Android view; Crash when trying to use a custom font that doesn't have ".Resources" in its EmbeddedResourceId; BubblePopup appearing as ModalPopup on UWP when window is small or not near top left of screen; UWP back button only clears top most popup; UWP, SegmentedControl has shadow not showing state correctly; TargetedMenu rendering is too slow;
    1.7.0.0: New: FlyoutPopup makes it easy to create flyout views that dock on the left, right, top or bottom sides of the screen.

    1.6.7: Fixed: Label Autofit in Android fails if the system font size has been changed (via device's settings);  SegmentedControl randomly has spaces between segments; Segmented labels in UWP may slowly shrink to MinFontSize when SyncSegmentFontSizes is enabled;

    1.6.2.1: Fixed: UWP throws "System.IO.FileLoadException: ... SharpDX.Direct2D1, Version=4.2.0" because SharpDX.Direct2D1 NuGet upgraded in Forms9Patch.UWP build but not in the Forms9Patch.nuspec.
